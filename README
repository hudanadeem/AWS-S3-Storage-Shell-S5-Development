TO RUN SCRIPT

python a1.py



Maybe a restrcition for one of my functions?

My laptop is Windows so I adjusted my non-S3 commands to get Windows 
in my code I have..

if platform.system() == "Windows":
    # changing to make commands for Windows
    line = line.replace("ls", "dir").replace("pwd", "cd")

I believe if you're in shell and you have a macbook it should work? but I'm not 100% sure.
